1.Watering= we'll calcualate humidity and temperature. based on that model will decide how much water is needed on that day and it'll provide that amount
	of water in garden. we need 12V water pump & pipe for water circulation.
2.soil = we can understand soil's condition using soil moisture sensor. It'll help us to decide the right decision for the soil.
3.WiFi module= If we use arduino wifi in the garden. it'll send us report of everything about the garden. we can take necessary steps remotely.
4.LDR=LDR detects low intensity light,it'll turn on to give enough light to plants.
5.PIR sensor & buzzer = animals are harmful for plants. We can implement PIR sensor. If any animal attacks on plants , PIR sensor will detect motion and the buzzer
	will turn on .
